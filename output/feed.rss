&lt;p&gt;Hello, world! This is my first blog post, and I am very excited to share it with you. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Stefano Locatelli, and I am a Microsoft employee and a Microsoft 365 Development and Azure enthusiast. In this blog, I will write about my personal experiences, learnings, and insights on these topics, as well as some of the projects and solutions that I have worked on or created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you will find this blog interesting and useful, and I look forward to hearing your feedback and comments. You can contact me via &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/locatellistefano"&gt;Linkedin&lt;/a&gt; or by e-mail at &lt;code&gt;locatellist AT gmail DOT com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
